              <p>
              Total number of tokens are LIMITED to 100M. Initially only a limited percentage of the total will be released in DeFi platforms.
              Each year on certain calnedar dates, (or based on community votes) more tokens will be released until total # of tokens reach 100% of the total tokens ie. 50M in circulation. 
              The community of stakeholders may also decide to "burn" tokens or buy them back to deflate the tokens and increase their values.
