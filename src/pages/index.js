                </header>
                <p> NoContract (NoCon) is a project to replace real-world physical contracts with Smart Ones!!!</p>
                <p>We remove 'trusted middle-man' from the traditional contracts, allowing parties to interact directly over smart contracts in a democratic environment.</p>
                <p>NoCon is DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation), gonverned by a community of stakeholders. This means NoCon is:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Decentralised: Not governed by one single, centralised entity</li>
                <li>Autonomous: NoCon can automatically execute operations on its own without any intervention.</li>
                <li>Organisation: NoCon is governed by its own predetermined rules, like an organization. The rules to govern the organisation is determined by voting, and the majority will decide the future direction of the organisation.</li>

                </ul>
                <p>DAO can grow by itself without depending on its creator(s).
                  <br/>
                  <strong> It is a true a democracy! </strong> </p>

              NOC tokens have two major purposes:
            <br/>
            A. As the <b> staking token </b> to put into the Escrow smart contract to facilitate and approval of the mutual agreements between parties.
            <br/>
            B. As the <b>currency </b> to be transferred from the buyer to the seller of goods and services.
            <br/><br/>
            Other purposes include staking into Liquidity Pools and DAO governance (e.g. voting).
            <br/><br/>
            <h3 >How stakeholders will be incentivised?</h3>


            <ol >
              <li>The token holder can <b> HODL </b> the token and sell for profit later, as the NOC token has intrinsic value (see purposes above) and will appreciate over time proportional to the number of users using the system.</li>
              <li>The token holder can <b>provide liquidity </b> by buying a pair such as BNB-NOC in a DeFi swap - they will be rewarded for LP and the fees (outside NoCon DApp).</li>
              <li>The token holder can <b> transfer </b> their token to our Staker smart contract and get the fees from Escrow smart contract (inside NoCon DApp).</li>
              <li>The token holder can <b> lend </b> their token to the parties who are initiating a mutual contract (e.g. to buy/sell goods). In this case, the lender will collect interest from the borrower. The interest rate will be driven by the market participants or negotiated between lender/borrower (outside NoCon Dapp).</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>How developers will be rewarded?</h3>
              This will be done through NoCon DAO governance (voting).
              The devleopers will propose the compensation they think it's fair based on their level of contribution and put it into vote.
              The token holders will vote and either accept, decline or counter-offer the reward. The reward for the developers will come out of the ‚ÄúDevelopment Pool‚Äù which is locked for release to the developers and contributors.

              <p>
              We have a long-term vision for NoContract project. However, we only lay-out our short to mid-terms roadmap for two reasons:
              <br/>
              1.  given the fast-moving nature of Smart Contracts world, protocols and technologies are progressing in an unprecedented rate; making our long term vision very likely to change; and (more importantly)
              <br/>
              2. This project is a DAO! It doesn‚Äôt matter what our visions are! After all, it‚Äôs the community who will decide about the direction of the project üòä              <br/>
              </p>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ul style={{textAlign:'left'}}>
              <li> <b>PoC</b>  ‚Äì create and test shell of the contract and all functions (Approve, Transfer, Receive..),  decide about protocol, DAO Governance code</li>
              <li> <b>MVP</b>  ‚Äì build and test the MVP including DAO app, create and lock tokens, create contracts in TestNet (will be deployed to MainNet), first use-case = contract to buy/sell goods & services (think distributed eBay!) </li>
              <li><b>Audit</b> the code and smart contract security ‚Äì make sure it‚Äôs watertight mate!</li>
              <li>List the initial tokens in PancakeSwap </li>
              <li><b>Into the wild (aka Go-live)!</b></li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Roadmap post go-live</h3>

            <ul style={{textAlign:'left'}}>
              <li><b>Contract Templates</b> - Pre defined contract templates to choose from such as bartering contract, care sales contract, insurance, employment etc.</li>
              <li><b>Dynamic Terms of Contract</b> - The parties can define terms of the contract like # of NOC tokens to stake</li>
              <li><b>User Defined Templates</b>: Community can create templates for others to use or even sell the template in the marketplace</li>
              <li><b>Use Collaterial</b> instead of fiat to buy/borrow NOC tokens and stake them</li>
              <li><b>Borrow NOC</b> - others can stake their tokens as collateral for your trade, and you pay interest to them while the contract is yet not approved by both parties</li>
              <li><b>NoContract API</b>  </li>
              <li><b>Distributed AirBnb</b>  </li>
